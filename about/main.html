                Anime is a style of animation that originated in Japan and has become 
                a global phenomenon. Known for its colorful artwork, fantastical themes, 
                and vibrant characters, anime covers a wide range of genres, from action 
                and adventure to romance and horror. Popular anime series like 
                <strong>One Piece</strong>, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong>, and <strong>Naruto</strong> 
                have captivated audiences worldwide with their unique storytelling and cultural richness.

                The word "anime" is derived from the English word "animation," but in Japan, 
                it refers to any kind of animated work, regardless of origin. Anime often features 
                distinct character designs, exaggerated facial expressions, and imaginative worlds that 
                transport viewers to realms beyond their imagination.
